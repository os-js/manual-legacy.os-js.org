## What is this ?

OS.js is a desktop environment that runs in a browser. It allows you to run web applications (and even stream remote applications) and manage files on local and remote filesystems.

Can be installed on any platform and runs in any modern web browser (IE10+).

## I want to try it out!

Then head over to the [installation documentation](/installation). It only takes a few minutes to set up via a few simple commands.

If you don't want to install it, there is a [LEGACY demo](https://demo-legacy.os-js.org/) online.
