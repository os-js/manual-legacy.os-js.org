# Using Iframe

Be default this application comes with a `data/` directory for you to host the files. But this can also be changed to a remote URL by modifying the application source.

It also comes with a file named `osjs.js` that allows you to communicate with OS.js via messaging.

This package is compiled just like a normal `Application`.
